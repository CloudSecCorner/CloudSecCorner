### Understanding Network Protocl Types 

### Network Protocol Type 
  - The network protocol type is simply the set of rules which are used to describe how a system communicates with other devices over a network 

  - if 2 devices wants to exchanage a message , both systems needs to negotiate on a common set of rules which is the network protocol type 

  ### Internat Control Message Protocol 

  - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) define RFC 792 is typically used to provide error reporting on a network 

  ### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

  - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) defined by RFC 793 is connection-oriented protocol which operates are Transport Layer of both the open systems interconnection (OSI) reference model and the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol ( TCP / IP) protocol stack 

  - it is desigened to provide reliable transportation of the datagrams over a network 

  - it provides reasssurance by initianlizing 3 way handshake before communicating data between the senser the receiver

  ### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

  - user datagram protocol (UDP), defined by RFC 768 is a connectionless protocol 

  - this protocol also operates at the transport layer of both the open systems interconnection (OSI) referenece model and the transmission control protocol / Internet Protocol ( TCP / IP) protocol stack 


  - However unlike TCP ( TCP ) the user datagram protocol ( UDP) does not provide any guarantee or reassurance of the delivery of datagrams across a network 

  - Not all protocols at the application layer uses TCP there are many layer 7 protocos which uses the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP)

  ### Internet Protocol (IP)

  - Internet Protocol (IP) define RFC 791 was created for operations in interconnected systems of packet-switched computer communication networks 

  - Connectionless
  - Uses Best Effort 
  - Media Independent
