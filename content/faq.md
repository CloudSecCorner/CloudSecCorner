## What is the legal and project structure?

- The OCI is run under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. It is intended to  be lightweight, with three layers of leadership: The Trademark Board (TB), Technical Leadership (TDC) and a Technical Oversight Board (TOB).
- The most important functions are done by the Technical Leadership (TDC) of the project, who are the contributors and maintainers of OCI.
- There is a Technical Oversight Board (TOB), composed of vendor-neutral individuals who provide oversight of the technical leadership and serve as a point of appeal. But, it is assumed that the technical leadership will do the right thing. We are not creating a structure for sponsors of the project to pay for the right to influence the technical direction of the project. Influence comes through code contribution.
- Finally, most of administrative and fiduciary duties and responsibilities are provided by the Linux Foundation, including:
    - Normal fiduciary responsibilities associated with the board of any foundation (approving budgets, auditing financials, etc.)
    - Setting policies for trademark enforcement
    - Appointing a director for OCI if necessary
    - Serving as a point of appeal if there are formal complaints about the TOB or technical leadership of the Projects failing to follow its established technical governance procedure

## What are the responsibilities of the Technical Oversight Board (TOB)?

- Serving as a source of appeal if the project technical leadership is not fulfilling its duties or is operating in a manner that is clearly biased by the commercial concerns of the technical leadershipâ€™s employers
- Reviewing the tests established by the technical leadership for adherence to specification
- Reviewing any policies or procedures established by the technical leadership.
